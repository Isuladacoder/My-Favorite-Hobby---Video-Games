    <p>I really love to play video games. Why? Well, there is a wide varity from kart-racers to 3D exploration to platformers and RPGs. There is pretty much a game for somebody to enjoy. There are also games that have multiplayer so you can play with friends and family to have a good time. Another reason why I like video games because it takes your mind off of the difficulties of life but it can have some elements that are dark or sad relating with the hardships of life. There are games with simple stories that are explained in 1 or 2 cutscenes but there are those complex stories with many plot twists and these games allow gamers to make theories on these stories.These are some reasons why I like video games.Here are some of my favorite video games.</p>
